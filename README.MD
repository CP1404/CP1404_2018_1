# In-Class Code for CP1404 2018 SP1 Townsville, IT@JCU

This repo is a collection of demos and quick examples 
from the lectures of CP1404.  
_It is not intended to be best-practice, well-documented code._  
Some of it will be just fine, but I usually make no extra effort after class to "fix up" or complete examples.
